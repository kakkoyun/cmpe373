\large{\paragraph{}This report prepared based on the agent-based model of ``Social Dynamics of Science`` paper written by Xiaoling Sun, Jasleen Kaur, Sta\v{s}a Milojevi\'{c}, Alessandro Flammini, Filippo Menczer. The evaluation and result of the simulation overlap with the paper results and these results provide quantitive support for the key role of social communications in shaping the dynamics and diciplines of science.}\\
\large{\paragraph{}Simulation models designed as explained in this paper with the facts about the complex socio-cognitive interactions of a changing group of scholars, publications, and scientiÔ¨Åc communities.}
