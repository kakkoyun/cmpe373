\section{Social Dynamics of Science Models}
\subsection{Origin of Study}
\paragraph{}
The purpose that motivated us to do this project, "Social Dynamics of Science" article[1].
First we tried to implement the simulation through the article.
Models and simulation process implemented as explained in the article.

In the proposed model on this paper; Social Dynamics of Science, we build a social network of collaborations whose nodes are authors, linked by coauthored papers.
Each author is represented by a list of disciplines indicating the scientiﬁc ﬁelds they have been working on, and every discipline has a list of papers.
Similarly, each link is a paper describing the collaborations between these two authors.

At this stage, the current implementation does not cover all the simulation that expressed in the paper. 
In later stages of the project, implementation of simulation will be completed. 
In futher this project will develop and test with the real scholars data of Turkey. 
\subsection{Improvements}
\paragraph{}
Models of the simulation will be develop and interactions between agents will be stronger than expressed in paper.
The simulation iterations will be implement as one year cycle. In one iteration random quantity of author will be selected and walks are going to start from these nodes.
With these developments, we aim to have more realistic simulation of knowledge distribution.
