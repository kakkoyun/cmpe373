\subsection{Origin of Study}
\paragraph{}
The purpose that motivated us to do this project, "Social Dynamics of Science" article[1].
First we tried to implement the simulation through the article.
Models and simulation process implemented as explained in the article.
At this stage, the current implementation does not cover all the simulation that expressed in the paper. 
In later stages of the project, implementation of simulation will be completedis open to develop and
