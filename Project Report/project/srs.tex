\paragraph{}
The simulation implemented with Repast agent-based modelling and simulation toolkit.
Repast has a variety of features, such as beign fully object-oriented, including a fully concurrent discrete event scheduler; both sequential and parallel, having social network modeling support tools.
Repast models can be developed in many languages, in this simulation we prefered to implement models and interactions with Java.
The simulation results will analyse with R. 
\paragraph{}
For coding we used an intergrated development environment Eclipse.
For documentation we used JavaDoc.
All programs run on Debian GNU/Linux Operation System.
